### What we learned

We learnt about many things while working on this project, how to merge your personal work with the project, working with new people and how to relate with one another. Different Members worked on different pages like the landing page, the about us page, recipe page et cetera. Many of us learn how to use github in pushing and pulling of work, how to fork and clone another person's work to adjust some little things. We brainstorm whenever we are facing any issue which make our work more efficient and effective.  


### Continued development

Individually, everyone will like to learn more about HTML, CSS and most especially JAVASCRIPT.


### Useful resources

- [Scrimba V2](https://www.example.com) - Scrimba Video help us alot in learning about HTML AND CSS, it is self explanatory which make it more easy to understand.
- [Codeguage](https://www.example.com) - Codeguage really helped alot during this progect, we were able to sort some javascript problem with it. We'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
